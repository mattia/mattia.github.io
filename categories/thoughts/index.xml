      <description>After reading Atomic Habits from James Clear last year I subscribed to his “3-2-1” newsletter. It’s been a good read in my Thursday (or on most occasions Friday) routine, or should I say habit? 😀.
One of the most recent issues of the newsletter is titled “3-2-1: How to approach life, and how to succeed as a writer” and it starts as usual with 3 ideas from the author.
In this post I would like to expand a little on what struck me the most in the first idea they wrote in the aforementioned issue.</description>
